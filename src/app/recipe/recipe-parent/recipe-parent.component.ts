        over medium-high heat. Add butter, sugar, salt and nutmeg.
        When mixture starts to simmer, reduce heat to medium and add flour.
        Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture comes together into a soft dough ball,
        about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer to a mixing bowl.
        Pour in vanilla extract. Break up dough with a whisk or fork, and let cool
        for about 5 minutes.`,
        `Break an egg into the bowl with the dough and whisk until egg is
        incorporated and dough becomes smooth and sticky, 4 to 5 minutes.
        Dough will stick inside the whisk; clean out dough with a spatula
        before adding successive eggs, 1 at a time. Whisk in each egg until
        thoroughly incorporated into the dough. Clear dough from whisk;
        scrape down sides of bowl. Cover dough with plastic wrap and chill
        for about an hour.`,
        `Place bacon in cold skillet. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally,
        until bacon is browned and crisp and fat is rendered, 5 to 8 minutes.
        Transfer bacon pieces to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. When bacon is cool
        enough to handle, place it on a cutting board and chop into small pieces.
        Reserve some bacon bits for topping the doughnuts.`,
